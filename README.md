# Factorio Blueprint Entities And Items To Combinator Converter

This simple scripts takes a factorio blueprint string and converts it to constant combinators holding the signals of items needed to build the blueprint.

Tested with 0.16 but as long as the bp string format does not change it should work in the future as well.
